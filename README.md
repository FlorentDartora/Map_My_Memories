# Map_My_Memories

Hello there !

I'm excited to share Map My Memories, a web-GIS application I built to showcase my travel adventures. Originally designed to share stories with family, I'm thrilled to make it public.
The application lets you explore various locations I've visited through an interactive map, enriched with photographs I took along the way. As a GIS and photography passionate, this was to me an exciting way to share my pictures and bring my travel journeys to life !

Key Features:
- Dynamic Basemap: The application utilizes the "Colored Pencil Map" from ESRI, providing a visually appealing and detailed backdrop for the travel points.  
- 100+ Markers : Each location visited is pinpointed with a custom icon, for a quick visual reference. 
- Route Visualization: For road trips, the application dynamically generates routes between locations, visually connecting the adventure.
- Interactive Pop-ups: Click on a marker to uncover details like the visit date and captivating images of the spot.
- Search widget : A search widget allow to easily display a specific location on the map.
- Date Filtering : Use a slider to display points based on a travel timeline, for a tailored viewing experience.
- Travel Insights : Explore the countries I've visited, with a particular focus on US states and National Parks.

Technical Stack : 
- Front-End : I selected ArcGIS SDK for JavaScript as a mapping library and used ESRI Calcite Design System for style. Website is hosted in AWS S3 and distributed by AWS Cloudfront.
- Back-End : A node.js Express Server wrapped and deployed into AWS Lambda. APIs are exposed throught AWS API Gateway.
